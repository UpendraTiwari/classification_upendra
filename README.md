Implement the Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours algorithms from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.  The algorithm must be implemented as a function with arguments, x_train (the features) and y_train (the output).  Usage of any library that has an implementation is forbidden.
